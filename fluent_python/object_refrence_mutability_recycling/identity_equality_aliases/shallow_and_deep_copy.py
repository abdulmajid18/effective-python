# shallow copy
"""
However, using the constructor or [:] produces a shallow copy (i.e., the
outermost container is duplicated, but the copy is filled with references to
the same items held by the original container). This saves memory and
causes no problems if all the items are immutable. But if there are mutable
items, this may lead to unpleasant surprises.

"""
Working with shallow copies is not always a problem, but sometimes you
need to make deep copies (i.e., duplicates that do not share references of
embedded objects). The copy module provides the deepcopy and copy
functions that return deep and shallow copies of arbitrary objects

Note that making deep copies is not a simple matter in the general case.
Objects may have cyclic references that would cause a na√Øve algorithm to
enter an infinite loop. The deepcopy function remembers the objects
already copied to handle cyclic references gracefully
